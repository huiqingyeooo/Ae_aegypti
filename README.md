<span eid="Q30953">Dengue</span>, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is endemic and prevalent in Singapore. It is also known as break-bone fever, which points to the severe muscle and joint pains that one can get when contracting dengue.[^1] Such is the prominence of this disease that it has become a household name in Singapore, and decades of public health messaging has educated the public well that the culprit of this disease is a “black-and-white mosquito”, the *Aedes aegypti*.[^2] Many will be surprised to know that this species has a non-native origin, given its ubiquitous nature and ability to thrive in Singapore’s urban niches. Weaving together history with scientific evidence, this story traces the challenges of *Ae. aegypti* vector control in Singapore and explores why dengue is still around despite decades of intensive vector control efforts.

## A human-loving mosquito
*Ae. aegypti* is an anthropophilic species. Not only does it feed preferentially on human[^3], it almost exclusively breeds in specialised artificial container habitats such as flowerpots and bath tubs.[^4] They can breed in small amounts of water that are relatively low in organic matter and high in oxygen.[^5,6] Such adaptations have enabled this species to take easy advantage of stagnant water habitats.

The eggs of *Ae. aegypti* are laid just above the waterline of containers and are desiccant-resistant, which means they can survive without water for months at a time.[^7] This form is likely how it was introduced into Singapore, through trade routes carrying artificial containers with accumulated water. Though the first record of it in 1908 in Singapore was as *Stegomyia fasciata*[^8], the description of the mosquito’s distinctive lyre-shaped white scales on its thorax means identification as *Ae. aegypti* is unmistakeable. Despite its medical significance importance and far-reaching impacts on public health now, the first detection of this species on the shores of Singapore was met without much alarm and was merely treated as a new insect record.

## Outbreaks in Singapore
The increase in mosquito-borne diseases as a result of rapid urbanization happening in Singapore is not new. Since the 1900s, the island’s malaria cases were rampant because the malarial vectors (*Anopheles* species) thrive in disturbed forest edge habitats after forests were cleared for agriculture.[^9,10] Authorities dealt with the malaria problem swiftly, by eliminating breeding habitats such as seepages and ditches and tightening surveillance measures.[^9] Singapore was declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization in 1982.[^9] Despite Singapore’s best efforts, however, stemming dengue transmission has not been as successful, largely owing to the increase in urban habitats ideal for *Ae. aegypti*.

After World War II and the end of the Japanese occupation, citizens of Singapore focused on recovering their livelihoods, and many turned to hawker trades to earn income.[^11] Without proper sanitation and refuse systems, however, waste soon piled up and provided ideal conditions for the accumulation of stagnant water for mosquitoes to breed.[^11] The development of Singapore with the clearing of land to make way for buildings during this period marks the gradual transition of an increased availability of suitable urban habitats for *Ae. aegypti*.

While cases of dengue had been recorded in Singapore as early as 1901[^12], it was not until 1960, with an outbreak of an urban and more severe form – the dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) – that more attention turned from fighting malaria to dengue.[^4,13] A year later, Dr. Albert Rudnick, an entomologist and virologist from the University of California, sampled mosquitoes from Singapore and established that the haemorrhagic form was transmitted by *Ae. aegypti*.[^14] By then, this non-native species had firmly established itself in Singapore’s growing urban landscape. Subsequently, *Ae. aegypti* facilitated many outbreaks of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases in Singapore such as chikungunya in 2008[^15], and more recently Zika in 2016[^16], further highlighting its impact on epidemics in the urban areas.

## The relentless chase
The first DHF outbreak in 1960 recorded 70 hospitalised cases 17 and was a catalyst for authorities to set up the first governmental department dedicated to vector control, the Vector Control Unit (later the Vector Control Research Department – VCRD).[^4] Prior to this, the control of mosquitoes was seen as a public health responsibility under the Health department. This move placed vector control at the forefront of the government agenda and facilitated the set-up of an integrated system to tackle the growing dengue challenge. It was a nation-wide effort, involving regular surveillance and insecticide application as well as infrastructural changes such as the development of piping systems to phase out the need for stored water containers, which were – and remain – a prime breeding habitat for *Ae. aegypti*.

<param ve-image url="controlOfAedesVectors.jpg">

While the use of insecticides was effective in killing mosquitoes, their widespread application and the fast generation times of the mosquito contributed to the development of insecticide resistance. To combat this, Singapore has adapted a novel technology, releasing millions of male *Ae. aegypti* infected with the insect bacteria *Wolbachia*. This control strategy is species-specific, and has been effective in bringing *Ae. aegypti* populations down in areas where the Wolbachia-infected males were released.

Following the success of the *Wolbachia* control method, there are concerns that other locally occurring and adaptable species may start to take over the ecological niche left by *Ae. aegypti*. The Asian Tiger mosquito (*Aedes albopictus*) is a widespread species in Singapore, occupying a wide range of vegetated to urban habitats. A “black-and-white” mosquito as well, it belongs to the same classification of subgenus *Stegomyia* as *Ae. aegypti*, and is a competent vector for dengue, chikungunya and Zika. [^18,19] Already it is a widespread species involved in multiple epidemics worldwide.[^20] This is a good reminder that *Aedes* mosquitoes and humans are part of the urban ecological fabric, and intentionally removing a species may not be as straightforward as it seems.

## It takes a village for successful vector control
*Ae. aegypti* has been under intensive mosquito control in the past 60 years with noticeable decrease in its population size.[^21] Dengue cases are still on the rise however, with the top two highest cases in a year reported in the last three years (2020: 35,315 cases and 2022: 32,325 cases).[^22] This is despite the multitude of efforts and variety of vector control solutions in “chasing” down *Ae. aegypti*.

Inevitably, many of the breeding sites of *Ae. aegypti* occur indoors and mainly within  residences which are personal spaces and largely inaccessible for surveillance. Recognising this early on in the fight against dengue, the authorities rolled out a variety of anti-mosquito campaigns to educate the public and encourage kampung spirit (“gotong royong”) to look out for one another.[^23] This includes broadcasting anti-mosquito messages on the television and radio  , and a concise guide to “5-step mozzie wipeout” which identified common household areas where *Ae. aegypti* breed.[^23,24] The citizens were largely cooperative and receptive to the public health messaging, although interestingly, there were also reports of residents continuing to breed mosquito larvae as food for their fighting fishes[^25], a popular pastime at that time, even with ongoing dengue outbreaks in the 1970s.[^4]

To ensure that residents remain vigilant in eradicating *Aedes* breeding sites, the Disease-bearing Insects Act was passed in 1968 (now superseded by the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act in 1998). The Act illegalises breeding of any mosquito species at home and enable public health officers to enter and examine home premises for mosquito breeding.[^26] Fines are also imposed as a deterrent, and penalties have gotten more stringent over the years, suggesting that a proportion of the population continues to be negligent.

Today, the rise in dengue cases is partially owed to the decades-old successful vector control strategies. Ironically, low numbers of *Ae. aegypti* in Singapore have resulted in a large pool of susceptible citizens (low herd immunity), which means that more people are likely to succumb to dengue when an outbreak happens. These sentiments have been echoed by various authorities throughout the years. 

## Conclusion
Despite its non-native status, *Ae. aegypti* has firmly established itself in Singapore’s urban ecosystem. It is part of the urban wildlife, much like cockroaches and otters. Singapore is widely acknowledged as a country with a world-class mosquito surveillance system and the persistence of *Ae. aegypti* and dengue is not for the lack of vector control efforts. The complex relationships and interdependency between humans and the local vector *Aedes* species mean that vector control and management of dengue transmission remains a challenge for the many years to come.
