Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is endemic and prevalent in Singapore. It is also known as break-bone fever, which points to the severe muscle and joint pains that one can get when contracting dengue.[^1] Such is the prominence of this disease that it has become a household name in Singapore, and decades of public health messaging has educated the public well that the culprit of this disease is a “black-and-white mosquito”, the *Aedes aegypti*.[^2] Many will be surprised to know that this species has a non-native origin, given its ubiquitous nature and ability to thrive in Singapore’s urban niches. Weaving together history with scientific evidence, this story traces the challenges of *Ae. aegypti* vector control in Singapore and explores why dengue is still around despite decades of intensive vector control efforts.

## A human-loving mosquito
*Ae. aegypti* is an anthropophilic species. Not only does it feed preferentially on human[^3], it almost exclusively breeds in specialised artificial container habitats such as flowerpots and bath tubs.[^4] They can breed in small amounts of water that are relatively low in organic matter and high in oxygen.[^5,6] Such adaptations have enabled this species to take easy advantage of stagnant water habitats.

The eggs of *Ae. aegypti* are laid just above the waterline of containers and are desiccant-resistant, which means they can survive without water for months at a time.[^7] This form is likely how it was introduced into Singapore, through trade routes carrying artificial containers with accumulated water. Though the first record of it in 1908 in Singapore was as *Stegomyia fasciata*[^8], the description of the mosquito’s distinctive lyre-shaped white scales on its thorax means identification as *Ae. aegypti* is unmistakeable. Despite its medical significance importance and far-reaching impacts on public health now, the first detection of this species on the shores of Singapore was met without much alarm and was merely treated as a new insect record.

## Outbreaks in Singapore
The increase in mosquito-borne diseases as a result of rapid urbanization happening in Singapore is not new. Since the 1900s, the island’s malaria cases were rampant because the malarial vectors (*Anopheles* species) thrive in disturbed forest edge habitats after forests were cleared for agriculture.[^9,10] Authorities dealt with the malaria problem swiftly, by eliminating breeding habitats such as seepages and ditches and tightening surveillance measures.[^9] Singapore was declared malaria-free by the World Health Organization in 1982.[^9] Despite Singapore’s best efforts, however, stemming dengue transmission has not been as successful, largely owing to the increase in urban habitats ideal for *Ae. aegypti*.

After World War II and the end of the Japanese occupation, citizens of Singapore focused on recovering their livelihoods, and many turned to hawker trades to earn income.[^11] Without proper sanitation and refuse systems, however, waste soon piled up and provided ideal conditions for the accumulation of stagnant water for mosquitoes to breed.[^11] The development of Singapore with the clearing of land to make way for buildings during this period marks the gradual transition of an increased availability of suitable urban habitats for *Ae. aegypti*.

While cases of dengue had been recorded in Singapore as early as 1901[^12], it was not until 1960, with an outbreak of an urban and more severe form – the dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) – that more attention turned from fighting malaria to dengue.[^4,13] A year later, Dr. Albert Rudnick, an entomologist and virologist from the University of California, sampled mosquitoes from Singapore and established that the haemorrhagic form was transmitted by *Ae. aegypti*.[^14] By then, this non-native species had firmly established itself in Singapore’s growing urban landscape. Subsequently, *Ae. aegypti* facilitated many outbreaks of dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases in Singapore such as chikungunya in 2008[^15], and more recently Zika in 2016[^16], further highlighting its impact on epidemics in the urban areas.

## The relentless chase
The first DHF outbreak in 1960 recorded 70 hospitalised cases 17 and was a catalyst for authorities to set up the first governmental department dedicated to vector control, the Vector Control Unit (later the Vector Control Research Department – VCRD).[^4] Prior to this, the control of mosquitoes was seen as a public health responsibility under the Health department. This move placed vector control at the forefront of the government agenda and facilitated the set-up of an integrated system to tackle the growing dengue challenge. It was a nation-wide effort, involving regular surveillance and insecticide application as well as infrastructural changes such as the development of piping systems to phase out the need for stored water containers, which were – and remain – a prime breeding habitat for *Ae. aegypti*.

While the use of insecticides was effective in killing mosquitoes, their widespread application and the fast generation times of the mosquito contributed to the development of insecticide resistance. To combat this, Singapore has adapted a novel technology, releasing millions of male *Ae. aegypti* infected with the insect bacteria *Wolbachia*. This control strategy is species-specific, and has been effective in bringing *Ae. aegypti* populations down in areas where the Wolbachia-infected males were released.

# Basic usage

## Image

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]

## Map

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
